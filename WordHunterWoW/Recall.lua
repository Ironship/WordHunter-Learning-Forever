-- The recall check: a word you are learning stops showing its meaning on the
-- first click and asks how well you knew it instead.
--
-- Colouring a word Learning is a promise to come back to it, and the panel
-- keeps that promise by showing it coloured in every later quest. What it
-- could not tell was whether the colour was still needed. A click opened the
-- editor with the meaning already filled in, so the moment of finding out --
-- did I know this? -- was over before it started. With the check on, a word
-- that has been Learning for a day asks first: five buttons, one to five, and
-- only then the meaning. The rating is the player's own verdict, which is what
-- every flashcard program uses too; matching a typed answer against a
-- translation is guesswork about synonyms and spelling, and a verdict is not.
--
-- Ratings and example sentences live beside the word list rather than inside
-- it, in WordHunterWoWDB.recallByLocale. Two reasons. The editor deletes a
-- word's own entry when its wording matches the dictionary's, on purpose, so
-- anything stored on that entry is gone the day the player types the pack's
-- own meaning back in. And a word with no entry of its own is not a table
-- that persists at all: GetEffectiveWord builds a fresh one from the
-- dictionary every call. A table of its own, keyed the same way and split by
-- language the way the words are, survives both and never touches the WHW3
-- export, which a desktop program parses column by column.
--
-- Every function here takes the clock as an argument, like recordEncounter and
-- computeStats, so a test can move time rather than the tests having to wait.

-- A day in Learning before the first question. Shorter, and the question
-- lands the same evening the word was marked, when it was looked up an hour
-- ago and the answer is memory of the page rather than of the word.
local ASK_AFTER = 24 * 60 * 60
-- Between questions on the same word. Twenty hours rather than a day, so a
-- word asked at eight in the evening is asked again the next evening at seven
-- rather than waiting for the day after.

local EXAMPLE_MAX = 400
-- Difficult: enough ratings to mean something, and the recent ones low.
-- Five, not ten or twenty, because a word turns up in quests a handful of
-- times a month, and a threshold that takes a season to reach never fires.
--
-- That reasoning holds for the default and not for everybody. A reader who
-- meets a word several times an evening reaches five ratings in one sitting,
-- and a list built on five says "difficult" about words they simply had not
-- looked at twice yet. The number is theirs to set now; five is only where it
