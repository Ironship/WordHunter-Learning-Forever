-- missing passages never reaches them: "Besichtigt" is absent from all 30815
-- German quests even though "besichtigen" and "Besichtigung" are both there.
-- NPC gossip is not in the API at all.
--
-- The game client has all of it. This records passages the player actually
-- meets so they can be exported and folded back into the corpus. Off by
-- default: it grows SavedVariables, and most players installed this to read
-- quests, not to collect them.
