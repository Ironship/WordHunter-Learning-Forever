-- The four jobs a piece of text does in this addon, and the one size each of

-- player's own chat-window size in the editor's boxes. That gap is there at
-- 100%, so no slider could ever close it -- a multiplier lands on whatever
-- base it is given, and the bases disagreed.
--
-- Sizes, not font objects. A Blizzard font object carries colour as well as
-- size -- the Normal family is gold, Highlight is white, DisableSmall is grey
-- -- so re-basing strings onto one shared object would silently recolour a
-- dozen headings and labels, and nothing in the suite checks those colours.
-- SetFont on top of the object a string already has moves the size and leaves
-- the colour where it was, which is the move chromeFont has always made in the
-- quest panel.
--
-- heading and label keep the sizes the surfaces already agreed on, so nothing
-- on those two roles moves for anybody who has already chosen a size. Only
-- body had three values, and it is the only one that moves. meta shares
-- label's size and is named apart because what separates the two is colour.

-- object it has always been drawn from, and takes that object's size. A player

-- replacement for it. If a client has no such object, the role falls back to a

-- It is split because the word editor came up visibly bigger than the quest

-- real, and neither is a fault in the scaling:
--
--   * The window. A font size leaves the frame the size the player dragged it
--     to; SetScale multiplies the frame as well. So the editor grew and the
--     panel did not, and that is deliberate -- the panel is sized to sit beside
--     the game's own quest window, and the point of it is how much text fits.
--
--   * The letters. The surfaces draw from different Blizzard font objects: the
--     quest words are GameFontHighlight at 12, the editor's boxes are the chat
--     font and the word above them is 16, the list rows are 10. That gap is
--     already there at 100% and survives any change of mechanism, so making
--     every window scale the same way would not have closed it.
--
-- What was actually wrong was this panel: five sliders in one column, every one
-- of them reading 80-200%, invite a comparison no arrangement of the code can
-- honour. So they are two groups under headings that say what each one grows,
-- and the text sizes are given as the point size the letters end up at.
-- Different units is the part that stops the comparison; a heading alone still
-- leaves two numbers side by side for the eye to match up.
